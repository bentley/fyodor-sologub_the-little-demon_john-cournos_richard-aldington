			</h2>
			<p>“My soul, why are you thus dismayed?”</p>
			<p>“Because of the hate that surrounds the name of the author of ‘The Little Demon.’ Many people who disagree upon other things are agreed on this.”</p>
			<p>“Accept the malice and the abuse submissively.”</p>
			<p>“But is not our labour worthy of gratitude? Why then this hate?”</p>
			<p>“This hate is rather like fear. You waken the conscience too loudly, you are too frank.”</p>
			<p>“But isn’t there some use in my truth?”</p>
			<p>“You want compliments! But this is not Paris.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, it is not Paris!”</p>
			<p>“My soul, you are a true Parisienne, a child of European civilisation. You have come in a charming dress and in light sandals to a place where they wear smocks and greased boots. Do not be astonished if the greased boot sometimes steps rudely on your tender foot. Its possessor is an honest fellow.”</p>
			<p>“But what a morose, what an awkward fellow!”</p>
